# Pancake Verifier

## Dependencies

Currently requires both the Viper toolchain to be installed (`VIPER_HOME` needs to be set) and the cakeML compiler to be on the `PATH`.

## How to run

### Standalone

Run in standalone mode, which prints the generated Viper code to stdout, using `cargo r --bin pancake2viper -- example.pnk`.

### VS Code

The VS Code extension can be installed from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alegnani.pancake-ide). 
Note that the extension lacks behind the development branches quite significantly.
